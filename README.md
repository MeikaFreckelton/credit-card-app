## Planning

When planning this application, I decided to use Trello to manage my tasks and workload within the given time. 



## Tech Stack

- MongoDB as the database to store users and their cards and Mongoose to conenct to the database.
- Express and Node.js as the backend technologies.
- React as the front-end framework.
- 
- Packages include: 
  - React-dropdown
  - React-router-dom
  - Nodemon
  - History
  - Axios
  - Credit-card-type

## Features



- Card visual:
  - To recreate the cedit card image, I originally attempted to create it using CSS only, however I was unsure of how I would recreate the credit card chip, so I made the decision to create the card from scratch as an svg. 
  - Originally I had used this site to generate a CSS pattern, and so when I attempted to make my own pattern, I realised this site had an option to save the pattern as an unstyled svg, I downloaded that file and used it to make a pattern using Adobe Illustrator.
